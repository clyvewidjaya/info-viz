In our project we wanted to focus on cyclist safety in the city of Toronto. Cycling has many benefits for a 
city and its citizens such as lowering traffic congestion in busy parts of the city. By analyzing how safe junctions are in Toronto we hope that some people are more confident in cycling in the city.
